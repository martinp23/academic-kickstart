The Peeks group employs rational molecular design to build new materials, with a focus on exploring supramolecular and macromolecular chemistry towards sensing and light-harvesting applications. Read more on our research page, or learn about group members. You can see what we have worked on previously on our publications page. 



The Peeks group is based in the School of Chemistry at UNSW Sydney.
