## Industry projects

We welcome the opportunity to work with Australian and overseas industry to solve chemistry and data problems. We bring a problem-solving mindset and are not restricted by disciplinary boundaries. Get in touch for more details, or have a look at some of our capabilities in the list below:

 * Data analysis, simulation, and fitting
 * Computational chemistry 
 * Organic synthesis of small molecules
 * Analytical chemistry: quantitation, identification
 * Advanced characterisation, including spectroelectrochemistry 
 * Sustainability laboratory practice
 * And more.. if we can't do it, we can point you to someone who can!
