 abstract = {Abstract Aromaticity and antiaromaticity are foundational principes in organic chemistry, regularly invoked to explain stability, structure, and magnetic and electronic properties. There are ongoing challenges in assigning molecules as aromatic or antiaromatic using optical spectroscopy. Here we report spectroelectrochemical and computational analyses of porphyrin (18π neutral, aromatic) and norcorrole (16π neutral, antiaromatic), and their oxidized (16π porphyrin dication) and reduced (norcorrole 18π dianion) forms. Our results show that while the visible spectra are characteristic of (anti)aromaticity consistent with Hückel's rules, the IR spectra are much less informative, owing to the relative rigidity of norcorrole. The results have implications for the assignment of (anti)aromaticity in both ground-state and time-resolved spectra.},
