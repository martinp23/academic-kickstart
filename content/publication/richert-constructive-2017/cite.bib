 abstract = {Quantum interference in charge transport is attracting interest with applications in nanoelectronics and quantum computing. Here, the authors present a method for quantifying electronic transmission through molecules, and demonstrate constructive quantum interference in a molecule with two identical, parallel coupling paths.},
