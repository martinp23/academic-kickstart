abstract: "The smallest and most strained member of a family of π-conjugated cyclic porphyrin oligomers was synthesized by using pentapyridyl templates based on ferrocene and corannulene. Both templates are effective for directing the synthesis of the butadiyne-linked cyclic pentamer, despite the fact that the radii of their N5 donor sets are too small by 0.5 Å and 0.9 Å, respectively (from DFT calculations). The five-porphyrin nanoring exhibits a structured absorption spectrum and its fluorescence extends to 1200 nm, reflecting strong π conjugation and Herzberg–Teller vibronic coupling."
