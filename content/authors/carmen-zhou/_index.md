bio: Hi, I'm a first-year undergraduate student working with the Peeks group for my CHEM2999 project to metallate porphyrins and to explain the effects of different metals. I hope to pursue a career in research, so I'm excited to be finally getting some experience in the lab! I have a casual job on the weekend, and when I'm not studying for university or working, I like to relax by watching movies/tv-shows or reading.
