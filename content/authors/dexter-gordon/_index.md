# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Hi! I’m a Sydney local studying a PhD with the Peeks group at UNSW, having completed my Bachelor of Advanced Science (Hons) at this university in 2021. My primary research interests are synthetic organic chemistry, analytical techniques such as time-resolved spectrofluorometry, and computational chemistry. Outside of uni, I sometimes sing with Vox Canvas, a barbershop acapella group based in Sydney, and I have a keen interest in politics and urban development. After a long day working on my project, my cat Sammy is always waiting for me at home!
