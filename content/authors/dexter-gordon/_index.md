# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Hi! I'm a Sydney local currently in the final year of my Bachelor of Advanced Science. I’m studying Honours part-time with the Peeks group – I earn money as a building automation systems engineer, using specialist software to automate HVAC systems and build graphical interfaces for large commercial buildings. My interests are politics&#58; I'm in the leadership team of the youth wing of a major Australian political party, and I love to campaign for issues that are close to me! I like to cycle to uni when I’m not locked down in self-isolation.
